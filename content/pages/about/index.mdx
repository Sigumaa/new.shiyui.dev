## Experience  
Backend engineer working primarily with Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, and Shell Script.
Particularly passionate about Go, focusing on API development, system operations, and CI/CD improvements.

Currently a student and a freelance developer, working under a sole proprietorship contract.
Starting in April, I will be joining a traditional Japanese company (JTC) as an IT Engineer while continuing my contract-based development as a side job.

In my free time, I enjoy building various utility tools to enhance productivity, especially in Go.

## Hobbies
I enjoy reading, watching movies, and listening to music. Iâ€™m particularly passionate about club music, especially genres like UK Garage, UK Hardcore, UK Bass, and Drum & Bass (DnB). Iâ€™m always open to exploring new sounds and experiences. I keep track of my music listening habits on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/ja/user/shiyui), where I log my favorite tracks and discover new artists.

As for movies, Iâ€™m a fan of works by Christopher Nolan and enjoy films that challenge conventional storytelling.
